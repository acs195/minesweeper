# minesweeper notes:
- This is an exercise project.
- The backend API is coded in Python with FastApi micro-framework.
- The backend API is deployed to Google Cloud Run (https://aleapi-bot26wz5ma-ue.a.run.app/docs).
- The client API is coded in Javascript with Node.
- I did not finish the last requirement. However I believe that what I've done so far would be enough for the purpose of evaluation.
- You will notice that I am more a Python developer than a Node/Javascript one :)
- I guess that would be all.
