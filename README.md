# minesweeper notes:
- This is an exercise project
- The backend API is coded in Python with FastApi micro-framework
- The backend API is deployed to Google Cloud Run
- The client API is coded in Node/Javascript
- You will notice that I am more a Python developer than a Node/Javascript one :)



## Backend
The backend API handles the player's actions in the board.
Check out the README.md with backend folder

## Client
The client library is used to connect the frontend with the backend.
Check out the README.md with client folder
